                <h2> What is AI?</h2>
                <p>AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. This technology uses algorithims and data giving AI the ability to reason, learn, and solve problems. It's important to note that there are also different types of AI.</p>

                <p>Voice assistants such as Echo & Google Assistant are considered Narrow AI because they're designed for specific tasks. There is also generative AI which performs any intellectual task a human can do as well as Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a subset of AI where the system learns data without having to be programmed to do so.</p>

                <img src="images/ai-vs-people.jpg" alt="image showing AI doing a persons job" class="round">
                <p>According to an article in <a href="https://www.wral.com/business/technology/triangle-conference-americans-fear-ai-harm-2035/" target="_blank">wral.com</a>, the rise of intelligent machines is something to watch out for. Empathy, social/emotional intelligence, and critical thinking are going to be negatively impacted by AI. Nomatter what humanity might lose, people are still embracing the tools that AI creates.</p>

                <p class="tablet-desk">According to the article, AI is a tool people will continue to use even though there are downsides. These disadvantages include job loss, high implementation costs, and ethical concerns such as privacy violations and bias. </p>

                <p class="tablet-desk">A new research study found a majority of Americans are expecting AI to erode essential qualities from society. The risk of becoming overly reliant on AI and a decrease in human skills is also prevalent.</p>
